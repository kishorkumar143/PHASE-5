### Installation
 
1. Clone the repository:
 
   bash
   git clone :  https://github.com/kishorkumar143/PHASE-5.git
 
 Install the required Python packages:
 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
 
## Usage
 
Here's how to use the AI diabetes prediction system.
 
### Data Preparation
 
1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format. Ensure it includes features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, etc., and a target column indicating diabetes status (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic).
 
 # Data source:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)
 
# Training
This will train the model using your dataset and save the trained model to the `models/` directory.
 
### Inference
 
You can make predictions using the trained model by running the following command:
 
```bash
python predict.py --model models/your_model.pth --input data/sample_input.csv
```
 
This will output predictions based on the input data.
 
## Demo
 
If you'd like to see a demo of the AI diabetes prediction system in action, run the following command:
 
```bash
python demo.py
```
 
The demo will use a pre-trained model and sample data to make predictions.
 
## Model Performance
 
Include information about the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Provide references to relevant metrics and datasets used for evaluation.
Certainly, here's an updated README file that includes information about the dataset source and a brief project description:
 
# AI Diabetes Prediction System

## Introduction
 
This AI Diabetes Prediction System is designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on health and medical data. It is a valuable tool for healthcare professionals, researchers, and individuals to make informed decisions regarding diabetes risk assessment.
 
## Dataset Source
 
The dataset used in this project is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains various health-related features, such as glucose levels, blood pressure, age, and BMI, and a binary target variable indicating diabetes status (1 for diabetic, 0 for non-diabetic). The dataset has been preprocessed and included in the `data/` directory of this project for your convenience.
 
Please make sure to acknowledge and adhere to the dataset's original licensing and usage terms when using it in your project.
 
## Getting Started
 
These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the AI Diabetes Prediction System on your local machine.
 
### Prerequisites
 
Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
 
- Python (3.6 or later)
- Pip (Python package manager)
 
You can install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
 
### Installation
 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
 
   ```bash
   git clone  :(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)
   ```
 
2. Change your working directory to the project folder:
 
   ```bash
   cd ai-diabetes-prediction
   ```
 
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
 
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
 
4. Activate the virtual environment:
 
   - On Windows:
 
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
 
   - On macOS and Linux:
 
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
 
5. Install the required Python packages:
 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
 
## Usage
 
Here's how to use the AI Diabetes Prediction System:
 
### Data Preparation
 
1. You can use the included Pima Indians Diabetes Database in the `data/` directory for training and testing. This dataset has been preprocessed and is ready for use.
 
### Training
 
To train the model, run the following command:
 
```bash
python train.py --dataset data/diabetes_data.csv
```
 
This will train the model using the dataset and save the trained model to the `models/` directory.
 
### Inference
 
You can make predictions using the trained model by running the following command:
 
```bash
python predict.py --model models/your_model.pth --input data/sample_input.csv
```
 
This will output predictions based on the input data.
 
## Model Performance
 
Include information about the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Provide references to relevant metrics and datasets used for evaluation.
